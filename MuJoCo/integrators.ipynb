The final update is a weighted average of these four slopes/steps using the weights defined in RK4_B.\n",

For each of the 4 points it sets the next state in `mjData` and calls `mj_forwardSkip()` (this function allows to skip certain computational steps and sensor calculations) to evaluate the system at this state and record the resulting derivatives. Finally, in the last loop it computes the weighted sum of these derivatives and stores them in the `dX` state array. Then it resets the state to the initial values from the current invocation, and lastly calls `mj_advance()` with these weighted accelerations and velocities to advance the state of the simulation."

    "What is implicit?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about numerical integration for physics simulations, we're trying to advance the state of a dynamic system from the current time step to the next. Explicit methods, like Euler or RK4, use information that's already known (current position, velocity, and forces), calculate accelerations at the current state and use those accelerations to directly predict where the system will be in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In implicit methods, we set up an equation where the future state is the unknown. This equation includes how the forces at the future state affect the motion. We solve this equation to find the state that makes the dynamics consistent. Explicit methods are like predicting where a ball will be after throwing it, and implicit methods are like figuring out where you need to catch the ball so that all the physics equations are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the implicit integrator, first the code computes qfrc as the sum of smooth (net unconstrained) forces and constraint forces from mData. Then, it calls `mjd_smooth_vel()` that calculates the partial derivative of the dynamics with respect to velocity, which captures how small changes in velocity affect the forces and resulting accelerations in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implicit integrator then sets up the implicit system matrix that will be used to solve for the acceleration with a call to `mju_factorLUSparse()`. This matrix represents how the future state depends on both the current state and the unknown future accelerations. Then, the call to mju_solveLUSparse() solves the matrix. The implicit integrator uses LU factorization which is a decomposition technique to break down a matrix into the product of a lower triangular (L) and an upper triangular (U) matrix. MuJoCo optimizes this by only storing and operating on non-zero elements which helps with the performance when dealing with large, sparse matrices in physics simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the implicit integrator, the implicitfast integrator calls `mjd_smooth_vel()` with `flag_bias=0` (which subtracts `d qfrc_bias / d qvel from qDeriv` which ignores bias forces). Unlike the implicit, implicitfast uses a special optimized factorization and a specialized solver to advantage of MuJoCo's matrix structure. The implicitfast method uses a simpler derivative approximation and optimized factorization and solver implementations which makes it a good default choice for simulations that benefit from implicit integration (stiff systems, fast-changing forces).\n",
