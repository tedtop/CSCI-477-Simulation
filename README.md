# CSCI-477 Simulation Modeling

## Course Overview

This course explores the fascinating intersection of computational modeling and natural phenomena. We capture small pieces of our world by encoding them with computational structures - this is the essence of **simulation modeling**. Our **model** is a computer program that represents natural phenomena, while the **simulation** involves running the model to investigate questions or test hypotheses.

### Modern Applications

For the first time, this course examines the relationship between simulation modeling and **reinforcement learning** - an emerging field where agents maximize rewards in dynamic environments. We'll explore how computational models can represent dynamic environments effectively enough to enable the crucial "sim-to-real" transition for creating effective robots.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Write numerically efficient Python programs of intermediate complexity
- Construct algorithms that capture the physical characteristics of systems
- Solve ordinary differential equations computationally
- Verify and validate computer simulations
- Manipulate fundamental data structures of numerical computing (arrays)
- Represent and understand datasets graphically
- Connect classroom concepts to reinforcement learning platforms and evaluate sim-to-real transition effectiveness
